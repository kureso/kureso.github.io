Feel free to criticise me... I want to make notes.
I am currenty bachelor student of the Charles University at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics in Mathematical modelling.
My ambition is to delve in deeps of Geophysics, more precisely into Geomagnetism and geoeletricity.
Unfortunately I have no previous experience in any kind of scientific work and I hope this will be false statement in the near future.
